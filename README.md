>> This repo is basically the beginning of my path into the cybersecurity field. My first script, which is  a simple echo statement at the beginning of the year, was me learning how to use github and my introduction to coding. Every step since I began without any background knowledge was harder and more challenging that the last one, but incredibly satisfying.

There are so many things that I learned in these few months that I wouldn't have thought possible before. I remember being good with computers when I was little but because of life I drift away and reconnecting and achieving all these was very entertaining and fulfilling. Probably “System_Process” was one of my favorite scripts since I got to collect useful information from a useful application like task manager and perform these tasks and more all from the command line. The usefulness of this script and many others was appealing to me, these can be proved useful eventually, many of them need improvement and polish but have a lot of potential. For example the script “AutomationPS” can easily be improved and extended in order to save time and effort for a company. 

Once I feel more comfortable with my coding skills I’m sure I'll be able to take some of these scripts and create something powerful and useful, something that I could be proud of.
